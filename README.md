# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Logic using Siemens S7-1200 PLC & TP700 HMI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **traffic light control system** implemented using a **Siemens S7-1200 PLC (CPU 1212C DC/DC/DC)** and a **TP700 Comfort HMI panel**.  
The system simulates a real-world traffic junction where **North, West, and East directions** are controlled by a sequential traffic light program.

The goal of this project is to model the safe and efficient switching of traffic signals with a defined cycle of **green (15 sec)**, **yellow (5 sec)**, and **red** lights.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Used
- **PLC**: Siemens **S7-1200 CPU 1212C DC/DC/DC**  
- **HMI**: Siemens **TP700 Comfort Panel**  
- **Software**: TIA Portal (Step 7 + WinCC Comfort/Advanced)

## ðŸ”„ Traffic Light Sequence
The system follows a **3-step cycle**:

| Step | North | West | East |

| **1** | ðŸ”´ Red | ðŸ”´ Red | ðŸŸ¢ Green (15s) â†’ ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (5s) |
| **2** | ðŸ”´ Red | ðŸŸ¢ Green (15s) â†’ ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (5s) | ðŸ”´ Red |
| **3** | ðŸŸ¢ Green (15s) â†’ ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (5s) | ðŸ”´ Red | ðŸ”´ Red |

- Each **green phase = 15 seconds**  
- Each **yellow phase = 5 seconds**  
- Red lights remain ON during other directions' green phases

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Fully automated **traffic light cycle** using PLC logic  
- **Timers (TON)** used for signal duration handling  
- **Sequential switching** ensuring no conflicting green signals  
- **HMI TP700** provides real-time visualization of the junction with traffic lights animation

## ðŸ–¥ HMI Design
- Graphical interface designed on **TP700 Comfort Panel**  
- Displays **traffic light states** (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- Allows operator to **monitor and simulate traffic flow**  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- **PLC Program**: Written in **LAD in TIA Portal**  
- **HMI Screens**: Designed in **WinCC Comfort**
